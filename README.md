Would you love to turn your RaspberryPi into a Private Security Camera, but not sure how to setup the server and fetch the captured images/videos from the Pi or even better make your Pi detect a motion and send only the relevant images to a free app on your mobile device? 
Go to my guide here: https://anantthebiker.github.io/ThePrivateSecurityCamMatrixClient/ and setup your very own Pi based cam which not ony detects motion but also encrypts using state of the art double ratchet encryption and send the images to your personal server which forwards them to the mobile devices with authorized users.
