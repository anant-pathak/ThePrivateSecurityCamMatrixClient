Would you love to put your RaspberryPi to use as a Private Security Camera, but not sure how to setup the server and fetch the captured image/video from the Pi or even better make your Pi detect a motion and send only the relevant images to a free app on your mobile device? 
Go to my guide here: https://anantthebiker.github.io/ThePrivateSecurityCamMatrixClient/ and setup your very own Pi based cam which not ony detects motion but also encrypts using state of the art double ratchet encryption and sends the image to your personal server which forwards it to all your mobile devices with authorized users only.
