        <h1>Project: The Private Security Raspberry Pi Cam</h1>
        <p>When it comes to security cameras, there is a dearth of open source platforms that are hardware agnostic & can vouch for an end-to-end security from the point an image is captured by the camera till the point it travel through a communication channel to get uploaded to the cloud where only a set of authorized users can view or process it.</p>
        <p>That's where the "The Private Security Camera" comes in. It will be a lightweight solution, which can run even on a Raspberry Pi with an attached camera. It will be ideal for situations where we want the camera to only capture an image when it detects a motion(instead of uploading 1000hrs of video feed) and notify its authorized user via a secure 
            communication channel about its discovery.</p>
        <h2>Technical goal</h2>
        <p>The goal of this project is to develop software for a camera that can safely upload onto the cloud encrypted images that the Raspberry pi camera captures when it detects a motion in front.
            The cloud in this case would be our own secure "Matrix" home server, which hosts a chat room whose members are our authorized humans or ML bots.
        </p>
        <p>Technical ingredients:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Google cloud VM to host Matrix homeserver.</li>
            <li>Raspberry Pi with a Pi Camera to detect motion</li>
            <li>Custom Matrix based client on the Pi to send images as Encrypted messages onto the HomeServer.</li>
            <li>Off the shelf Matrix based client like Riot to receive messages from RaspberryPi.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Why MATRIX?</h2>
        <p>
        Matrix is a relatively new communication/messaging system built on the principles of GIT. In essence there'd be no 
        single server which will host and store all messages. Instead every client involved in the chat can have their own server also called as the HomeServer. 
        And everyone's Homeserver involved in that chat will have a Backup of those messages. You can find out more about it on:
        <a href="https://matrix.org">www.matrix.org</a> 
        </p>
        <p>In order to implement Matrix on the server we'd use its official server implementation called as <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/guides/installing-synapse">Synapse</a>.</p>
        <h3>Setting up Google Cloud VM:</h3>
        <p>Although I won't go into too much details about GCVM, but will give some top level parameters that I set and the librariess I installed during the setup.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Go to https://console.cloud.google.com </li>
            <li>Create your free/trial account, I used my student account. On the top left'd be a Hamburger menu -> Compute Engine -> VM Instances -> Create Instances. </li>
            <li>Give any name -> Your nearest regon for low latency -> MachineType: g1-small (1 vCPU, 1.7 GB memory); Series: N1 -> BootDisk: Debian Linux 10 -> Allow Http/Https Traffic -> Done. </li>
            <li>Right next to your VM Instance would be "SSH" button, click there and it'd open up your Linux via SSH on a terminal window. Not as fancy as a MAC/Windows but learn to live with it.</li>
            <li>sudo apt update</li>
            <li>sudo apt upgrade</li>
            <li>sudo reboot</li>
            <li>sudo apt install build-essential gdb python3-pycryptodome python3-pytest</li>
            <li>sudo apt install gcc-multilib libc6-dev-i386</li>
            <li>sudo apt install python3-pip</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Setting up synapse on the Linux Homeserver:</h3>
        Also, my guide on setting up Synapse is based off on the following other wonderful guides: <br>
        https://upcloud.com/community/tutorials/install-matrix-synapse/ <br>
        https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/INSTALL.md
        
        <ul>
            <li>
                <pre>
                    <code>
mkdir synapse
cd synapse
python3 -m venv .venv 
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install --upgrade setuptools
python3 -m pip install matrix-synapse
                    </code>
                    </pre> 
            </li>
            <li>How to upgrade the Matrix-Synapse installation at a later stage?
                <pre>
                    <code>
python3 -m pip install --upgrade matrix-synapse
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </li>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>
